# 3. Hybrid CLI Distribution Strategy

Date: 2025-09-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The design token toolkit has achieved significant performance improvements through ReScript integration (5-7x gains in color operations). To maximize the impact and accessibility of these optimizations, we need to distribute the toolkit as a professional CLI tool. However, we face competing requirements:

**Universal Accessibility Requirements:**
- Wide ecosystem compatibility (npm, Node.js environments)
- Standard installation workflow (`npm install -g`)
- Integration with existing development toolchains
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)

**Performance Excellence Requirements:**
- Maximum utilization of ReScript + Bun synergy
- Advanced performance monitoring and metrics
- Optimal runtime performance for computationally intensive operations
- Showcase of cutting-edge JavaScript performance techniques

**Current State Analysis:**
- Core ReScript modules provide verified 5-7x performance improvements
- CLI command layer implemented in TypeScript with Phase 1 optimizations complete
- Bun runtime offers superior performance for ReScript-compiled JavaScript
- npm ecosystem provides widest distribution reach

## Decision

We will implement a **Hybrid CLI Distribution Strategy** that provides two complementary distribution channels optimized for different user priorities and runtime environments.

### Distribution Architecture

**Primary Distribution: npm Package (Universal)**
```bash
npm install -g design-token-toolkit
design-tokens --help
```

**Secondary Distribution: Bun Binary (Performance-Optimized)**
```bash
npm install -g design-token-toolkit  # Includes Bun CLI
design-tokens-bun --help              # Performance-optimized version
./dist/design-tokens-bun --help       # Standalone binary option
```

### Implementation Strategy

**1. Unified Codebase with Runtime Detection**
- Single TypeScript/ReScript codebase shared between distributions
- Runtime environment detection for optimization selection
- Consistent command interface across both distributions

**2. Performance-Aware Feature Differentiation**
- Universal CLI: ReScript optimizations with standard Node.js compatibility
- Bun CLI: Enhanced performance monitoring, memory tracking, advanced metrics
- Progressive enhancement: Users can upgrade to Bun for maximum performance

**3. Dual Build Pipeline**
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:cli": "Compile for npm distribution",
    "build:bun-binary": "Compile standalone Bun binary",
    "build:all": "Complete dual distribution build",
    "cli:test": "Test npm CLI compatibility",
    "cli:test-bun": "Test Bun CLI optimizations"
  }
}
```

## Rationale

**Performance Optimization Strategy:**
- ReScript optimizations provide consistent 5-7x performance improvements
- Bun runtime maximizes ReScript-compiled JavaScript execution speed
- Performance monitoring demonstrates tangible benefits to users
- Dual distribution allows targeting both mass adoption and performance excellence

**Market Positioning:**
- npm distribution ensures maximum developer accessibility
- Bun distribution positions toolkit at forefront of JavaScript performance
- Hybrid approach reduces adoption friction while showcasing advanced capabilities
- Professional CLI elevates project from library to complete developer tool

**Technical Architecture Benefits:**
- Shared codebase reduces maintenance overhead
- Progressive enhancement aligns with modern web development principles
- Runtime detection enables optimal performance without user configuration
- Modular architecture supports future distribution channel additions

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Primary npm distribution ensures broad compatibility
- Bun distribution failure doesn't impact primary user base
- Incremental enhancement reduces implementation risk
- Proven ReScript performance benefits provide solid foundation

## Implementation Details

### Package Configuration
```json
{
  "name": "design-token-toolkit",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "bin": {
    "design-tokens": "./dist/src/cli.js",
    "design-tokens-bun": "./dist/src/cli-bun.js"
  },
  "engines": {
    "node": ">=16.0.0",
    "bun": ">=1.0.0"
  },
  "preferGlobal": true
}
```

### Command Interface Consistency
Both distributions provide identical command interfaces:
- `init` - Project initialization with ReScript-optimized color suggestions
- `analyze <color>` - AI-powered color analysis with performance metrics
- `palette <color>` - Multi-provider palette generation with accessibility
- `generate` - Style Dictionary token compilation
- `theme create/list/remove` - Complete theme management system

### Performance Enhancement Framework
```typescript
// Universal CLI: Basic performance monitoring
console.log(`‚ö° Operation: ${duration.toFixed(1)}ms (ReScript optimization)`);

// Bun CLI: Advanced performance monitoring
console.log(`üöÄ Bun Performance Metrics:`);
console.log(`   ‚è±Ô∏è  Duration: ${duration.toFixed(2)}ms`);
console.log(`   üß† Memory: ${(memoryDelta / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2)}MB`);
console.log(`   üìà Estimated speedup vs Node.js: ${speedup.toFixed(1)}x`);
```

### Error Handling Strategy
Standardized error handling patterns across both distributions:
- Graceful ReScript ‚Üí TypeScript fallbacks
- User-friendly error messages with actionable guidance
- Performance-aware fallback selection
- Consistent troubleshooting information
